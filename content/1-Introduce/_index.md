Welcome to this comprehensive workshop on integrating **AWS S3** with a backend application and deploying it on an **Amazon EC2** instance. This workshop is designed to guide you through the entire process, from setting up your cloud infrastructure to deploying a fully functional application that interacts with AWS services.

Whether you are a backend developer with experience looking to expand your cloud skills or someone new to AWS, this workshop will provide you with hands-on experience and practical knowledge. We will cover everything from creating and managing AWS resources to integrating your backend application with S3, making this an essential guide for anyone looking to leverage AWS in their projects.

By the end of this workshop, you will have a solid understanding of how to use AWS services to build scalable, secure, and efficient applications


### Amazon EC2 - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud

**Amazon EC2** is a cornerstone of cloud computing, providing scalable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows you to deploy virtual servers, known as instances, which can be configured with various operating systems and software to meet your needs. EC2's flexibility makes it an ideal choice for hosting web applications, running distributed systems, or performing big data analytics.

In this workshop, we’ll focus on using EC2 to host our backend application. You’ll learn how to launch an EC2 instance, configure it for your application, and take advantage of its auto-scaling and load balancing features to ensure your application is both scalable and resilient.

### Amazon S3 - Amazon Simple Storage Service

**Amazon S3** is one of the most reliable and cost-effective storage solutions available today. It provides object storage that is accessible from anywhere in the world, allowing you to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time. S3 is designed for 99.999999999% durability, ensuring your data is secure and always available.

In this workshop, we will use S3 to manage and store images for our application. You’ll learn how to create an S3 bucket, upload and retrieve files, and manage access permissions. Additionally, we’ll explore features like S3 versioning, lifecycle policies, and security settings to help you manage your data efficiently.

### AWS SDK - Your Toolkit for Building on AWS

The **AWS SDK** is a powerful toolkit that simplifies the process of interacting with AWS services from your application. It provides APIs and libraries for various programming languages, enabling you to perform tasks such as uploading files to S3, launching EC2 instances, and managing AWS resources directly from your code.

In this workshop, we will use the AWS SDK for Java to integrate S3 into our backend application. This includes setting up the SDK, writing code to interact with S3, and implementing features like pre-signed URLs for secure uploads. The AWS SDK will empower you to build sophisticated, cloud-enabled applications with ease.

### AWS Secrets Manager

**AWS Secrets Manager** is a service designed to help you securely manage and retrieve credentials, API keys, and other secrets. It eliminates the need to hard-code sensitive information in your application, reducing the risk of exposure and improving security.

We will cover how to use Secrets Manager to store and retrieve credentials for accessing AWS services, such as the keys needed to interact with S3. You’ll learn how to integrate Secrets Manager with your application to securely access these credentials, ensuring that your application follows best practices for security.
